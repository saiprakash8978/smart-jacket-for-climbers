# smart jacket for mountain climbers
*Features of the smart jacket*

*Real-Time coordinates*:Utilizes advanced lora and f sensors to continuously monitor movement and detect body coditions accurately.

*Automated Emergency Alerts*:Automatically sends SMS alerts to caregivers or family members upon detecting a the readings, ensuring timely assistance.

*GPS Location Tracking*:Integrates a GPS module to provide real-time location data, allowing caregivers to quickly locate the user in case of an emergency.

*Audible and Visual Feedback*:Features a buzzer for immediate audible alerts and a red LED indicator to visually signal the system's status.

*Lightweight and Comfortable Design*:Designed to be compact and non-intrusive, making it easy for young to elderly individuals to wear comfortably for extended periods.

*Minimized False Alarms*:Employs a combination of sensors and advanced algorithms to differentiate between normal activities and actual falls, reducing unnecessary
alerts.

*User -Friendly Interface*:An LCD display provides real-time updates on system status and sensor readings, enhancing user interaction.

*Continuous Monitoring*:The system resets after an alert and continues to monitor for future falls, ensuring ongoing safety.
